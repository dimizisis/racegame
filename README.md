## Objective
Traffic code learning game (KOK) through virtual driving (2D). The gameplay of the game will include the basic rules and markings, which the player should take into account and behave according to them. Otherwise, there will be consequences in terms of score or even the continuation of the game itself (it loses and has to restart the test).

The aim of this game is to learn the basic rules of road behavior, based mainly on the Road Traffic Code of our country (most of the basic rules apply worldwide). After a satisfactory time of interaction with the game, the player will be able to understand the importance of many of the objects that are on the road and related to the Traffic Code, but also the general importance of their strict observance.

The game is surrounded by a landscape, which is related to driving in the city, as there are (usually) objects that are related to the Traffic Code (signs, traffic lights, etc.). Also, the validity of the rules of road behavior, while it is universal, in the cities, in particular, their strict observance is mandatory, since in the cities the majority of accidents take place.

## Includes
There is a level for learning behavior on pedestrian crossings, speed limits and the "STOP" signal. There is also a cumulative level that contains all of the above items.

There are no personalized characters. As characters we can consider the car of the player himself and the other cars that the player will not manage. The player must manage his car so that it does not create a traffic problem with other cars that he does not handle. So, we want a smooth and rational interaction with other cars.

## Development
The game was developed on the platform "Greenfoot", continuing the game "Drive Thru" (first release).

## Purpose of Creation
There are similar games, both 2D and 3D. When it comes to similar games in the two dimensions, there is no one between them that focuses so much on the issues of proper driving rules, but on more specific issues (eg proper parking and parking). Similar three-dimensional games do exist, but are not available for free.
The purpose was to create the first two-dimensional game, which provides a more complete picture to the player in relation to the correct road behavior and its rules. The game is 2D. However, the two dimensions do not constitute a barrier to achieving the goal of the game.

## Requirements

### System Requirements
No special system requirements are required. A computer of any power of the last three / four (at least) years will be able to execute the game without any problems. The game is only available for PC, independent of operating system. With this in mind, the player will be able to control his character (in this case the car) with basic keyboard keys (arrow keys). The handling concerns the movement and direction of the player's car.

1. Java installed (version 8+)
