A stop sign is a traffic sign designed to notify drivers that they must come to a 
complete stop and make sure the intersection is safely clear of vehicles and 
pedestrians before continuing past the sign. In many countries, the sign is a red 
octagon with the word STOP, in either English or the national language of that 
particular country, displayed in white or yellow.

At the level of the game, try to stop before the "STOP" signal appears, which will 
be followed by a road perpendicular to that of your car. Each time you stop, you 
will be rewarded with points.
