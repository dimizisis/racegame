A pedestrian crossing or crosswalk is a place designated for pedestrians 
to cross a road, street or avenue.

Marked pedestrian crossings are often found at intersections, but may 
also be at other points on busy roads that would otherwise be too unsafe 
to cross without assistance due to vehicle numbers, speed or road widths. 
They are also commonly installed where large numbers of pedestrians are 
attempting to cross (such as in shopping areas) or where vulnerable road 
users (such as school children) regularly cross.
