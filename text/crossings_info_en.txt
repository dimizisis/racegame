A pedestrian crossing or crosswalk is a place designated for pedestrians to cross a road, street 
or avenue.

Marked pedestrian crossings are often found at intersections, but may also be at other points on 
busy roads that would otherwise be too unsafe to cross without assistance due to vehicle numbers, 
speed or road widths. They are also commonly installed where large numbers of pedestrians are 
attempting to cross (such as in shopping areas) or where vulnerable road users (such as school 
children) regularly cross.

At the level of the game, try to stop just before the passage, along with which there may be a 
traffic light. Each time you stop you will be rewarded with points. Use the horn only if a 
pedestrian is in danger.
