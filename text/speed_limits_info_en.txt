Speed limits are used in most countries to set the legal maximum, middle 
or minimum speed at which vehicles may travel on a given stretch of road.
Speed limits are generally indicated on a traffic sign reflecting the 
maximum, middle or minimum permitted expressed as kilometres per hour 
(km/h) and/or miles per hour (mph).

There are several reasons to regulate speed on roads. It is often done 
in an attempt to improve road traffic safety and reduce the number of 
casualties from traffic collisions. The World Health Organization (WHO) 
identified speed control as one of a number of steps that can be taken 
to reduce road casualties.

Speed limits may also be set to reduce the environmental impact of road 
traffic (vehicle noise, vibration, emissions) and as a political response 
to local community concerns for the safety of pedestrians. For example, 
a draft proposal from Germany's National Platform on the Future of 
Mobility task force recommended a blanket 130 km/h (81 mph) speed limit 
across the Autobahn to curb fuel consumption and carbon emissions. Some 
cities have reduced limits to as little as 30 km/h (19 mph) for both 
safety and efficiency reasons. However, some research indicates that 
changes in the speed limit may not always alter average vehicle speed.
