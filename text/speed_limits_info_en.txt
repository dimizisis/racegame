Speed limits are used in most countries to set the legal maximum, middle or minimum 
speed at which vehicles may travel on a given stretch of road.Speed limits are 
generally indicated on a traffic sign reflecting the maximum, middle or minimum 
permitted expressed as kilometres per hour (km/h) and/or miles per hour (mph).

There are several reasons to regulate speed on roads. It is often done in an attempt 
to improve road traffic safety and reduce the number of casualties from traffic 
collisions. The World Health Organization (WHO) identified speed control as one of a 
number of steps that can be taken to reduce road casualties.

Speed limits may also be set to reduce the environmental impact of road traffic 
(vehicle noise, vibration, emissions) and as a political response to local community 
concerns for the safety of pedestrians.

In this game, only speed signs that refer to the maximum speed permitted are available.
Try not to violate the speed limits.
